These instructions detail how to prepare a final project report, master's thesis, or PhD dissertation for Reykjavík University.
These instructions (unless otherwise stated) assume you are in the Reykjavík University School of Technology.
If you are in another school, you should make sure that the template meets your specific requirements.

Critical information:  The current version of the template uses Lua\LaTeX{} for enhanced font, code, and language support.
{\em It will not work on PDF\LaTeX{} nor classic \LaTeX.}
On debian based systems, you will need to install the \verb|texlive-luatex| package.

\begin{itemize}
\item [Overleaf Template:]  \url{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/reykjavik-university-project-report-and-thesis-template/fcwvcgnstrjs}
\item [Actively developed code:] \url{https://github.com/foleyj2/ru-thesis}
\item Current maintainers: Joseph Timothy Foley and Marcel Kyas.
  Questions, comments, complaints should be submitted at \url{https://github.com/foleyj2/ru-thesis/issues}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Frequently Asked Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em How do I use APA citations?}
  The template is setup to use IEEE citations by default.
  For those who want to use APA, you will need to adjust lines at the top of \path{main.tex}
  See the comments in the file right after \verb|\usepackage[backend=biber,style=ieee]{biblatex}|

    \item {\em Why does the margins and page size look weird?}
  As mentioned in the Abstract, this template was optimized for the B5 paper size so that it in print copy it has the same size as a standard textbook that fits on a standard bookshelf.
  This size also has the benefit of being similar to an e-Reader screen.
  
  \item {\em Why isn't there the RU logo on the front of the template on Overleaf/Git?}
    The official cover for these documents is generated by the Reykjavik University department.
    Putting the RU logo on GitHub or Overleaf's templates is incompatible with their licensing rules, so we cannot legally include it.
    See Section~\ref{sec:coverpage} about how to integrate the cover with the RU logo into your document.
    
  \item {\em My advisor doesn't like this format and asked me to change it.  
  What should I do?}
  Please contact the head of Graduate Affairs in your Department about what is required in the thesis format and who determines the formatting.

  \item {\em Why are there all these blank pages?}
  In printed books, content in the main body of the book traditionally starts on the Right i.e. ``Recto'' side.
  The template puts blank pages so that the Abstract, Table of Contents, and Chapters always start on the right side which may involve putting blank pages.
  
  \item {\em I've been told to use a Word Template.  Where is it?}
  There is no officially supported MS Word Template as of 2024-10-23 as far as the authors know.  
  
  The template authors tested MS Word to see if could properly typeset according to standard practice and found it had insufficient enforcement of formatting and margins.
  In addition, MS Word is unable to hyphenate Icelandic properly which results in very ugly typesetting.
  If you need a WYSIWYG editor to generate an Icelandic document, we recommend OpenOffice or LibreOffice with the extension developed at University of Iceland: \url{https://extensions.openoffice.org/fr/project/icelandic-hyphenation-dictionary}

  The authors do not recommend using MS Word for any document that must be printed as a book\footnote{Publishers accept MS Word documents then pay people in Asia to extract the content and convert it into XML or LaTeX.}.

  \item {\em Everything suddenly broke while I was trying to fix a citation}
  The most common causes of this problem:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{.bib} file has a weird UTF-8 character in it like a dash character "--"  (which is different than "-" or "---" separator). 
      This can even be space characters that are non standard.
      \item Forgetting to end each field with a ",".  
      \item Putting anything except "a-Z0-9" in the citation id field.  (the first one)
      \item Putting a URL in anything except the URL field
      \item Using ``\&'' to separate author names.  
      Names are separated with the word ``and''.
      Only use ``,'' when you are reversing the order e.g. ``Foley, Joseph''
      \item Having ``\&'' or underscore or ``\verb|\|'' in a field  
   \end{itemize}
   
  There are so many ways the citations can go wrong that Joe recommends using Zotero to export the \texttt{.bib} for beginning users.
  The JabRef tool is also very helpful for finding issues and managing the \texttt{.bib} files.
\end{itemize}

\section{Coverpage}\label{sec:coverpage}

Reykjavik University's communications department insists on a common outer appearance of all our theses.
A detailed explanation of what the cover should look like is at \url{https://en.ru.is/media/tvd/Instructions.pdf} though this document is from when the School of Technology was the School of Science and Engineering.

Instructions for specific schools or departments:
\begin{description}
\item[Department of Computer Science:]  To generate the cover with the RU logo, follow the instructions at
  \url{https://en.ru.is/media/skjol-td/Instructions_2020.pdf}, enter the relevant information into \url{https://en.ru.is/media/skjol-td/TD_E-cover_2019.pdf} and save the file as \texttt{cover.pdf}.
\item[Department of Engineering:]
  \begin{description}
  \item[M.Sc.] students be given a fill-in PDF cover in CANVAS under the Module ``Templates'' for the course T-901-MEI2 or equivalent.  It will have the name ``afræn forsíða á lokaverkefni'' for the Icelandic version or ``Cover Page for MSc thesis - English'' for the English one.
  \item[Ph.D.] students need to contact the RU Communications department for slightly different custom cover PDF before the document is to be published\footnote{Author Joseph highly suggests doing this 2 weeks before it is due.}.
  \end{description}
\end{description}

This class supports the RU Communication's desire for the common appearance through the \texttt{rucover} package.
Place \texttt{cover.pdf} into the same directory that you have your thesis' main file.
\LaTeX{} includes the file automatically if you add \verb|\usepackage{rucover}| to your preamble.
You can control the filename with \verb|\usepackage[filename=name.pdf]{rucover}|.


\section{Files and Directories/Folders}
\begin{itemize}
%\item \path{cls/}: contains the \path{rureport.cls} template used to format these instructions.
\item \path{graphics/:} contains the graphics to generate this document.
%\item \path{covers/:} contains the official covers (from RU Communications) to be put on the outside of the finished book.
\item \path{IEEEtran/:} contains the IEEE citation style files
%\item \path{deadlines.xlsx}: A deadline calculator that uses the semester's
%graduation date
\end{itemize}

\section{Signatures}
If you are making a print copy, you may need a signature page.
This is no longer required for most electronic submissions except perhaps PhD.

\section{Printing}
If you decide to print, make sure you are doing it on archival acid-free paper.
Otherwise, your document will yellow and fall apart in the library over time.
Traditionally, the student prints out and binds a copy for each advisor and examiner.
This may also be required if the research was funded or in certain circumstances.
If you are using a printing house to take care of the binding, they may be able to take the completed PDFs (cover and inside text) and print them for you.
Check with the printing house if they want it as A4 (to be trimmed) or as B5 (which they will take care of resizing).

\section{Submission}
When your document is finished and approved by your advisor, it needs to be uploaded to Skemman~\url{https://skemman.is}.
An important thing to remember is that the uploaded document will follow you for the rest of your career:
employers are likely to find it and skim it.
Make sure the document is something you would be proud to have associated with you.

The general submission sequence is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Defense complete, minor corrections complete after X days of work.
\item Save the completed thesis text as \path{main.pdf}
%\item Get signature pages signed by supervisor(s) and examiner.
%\item Sign the library release page.
%\item Scan the pages in, put them into the document in the appropriate places.
\item Open the official cover files in \path{cover}, fill in the appropriate fields, and save as a \path{cover.pdf}
%  \item Use a PDF binding tool such as PDFsam \url{https://pdfsam.org} to putthe cover before the first page and save as \path{thesis.pdf} 
\item Upload the finished \path{main.pdf} to Skemman.
\item An autogenerated email is sent from Skemman.
  This email should be forwarded to your admin such at \TItvdadmin{}.
\item Grade for the thesis is published.
\item Graduation!
\item Sometime after graduation, the published thesis is released by RU on Skemman for others to read and enjoy.
\end{enumerate}

\section{LaTeX Template Instructions}
Some information is at the top of \path{main.tex} file, this file is for a general overview and common problems.

\subsection{Getting started:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find a safe place to work on your thesis document.
  The author recommends Git on Overleaf, but anywhere data is backed up is a appropriate.
  If you are working with sensitive information, you should avoid bitbucket, google drive, dropbox, and any other free cloud service.
  If you think this is unnecessary, just consider how much time you will lose if your computer crashes.
   Due to Murphy's law, this is likely to happen just before your thesis is due\footnote{This has happened many times.}.

 \item Get a LaTeX installation.  We recommend TeXlive \url{https://www.tug.org/texlive/}
   For this template on windows, MiKTeX will also work, but will run very slowly the first time you render the template.
   You will need to enable the ``miktex'' option in the template to substitute packages.
   It is very very important that you run the ``MikTeX Update Wizard'' before you start.
   Otherwise you may get errors when you try to build the document.

   Under linux this is the ``texlive'' package.
   Under Mac/OSX this is the ``MacTeX'' distribution.

   Alternatively, if nothing you are doing is particularly private or proprietary, you can do development online using Overleaf.
   In this case, you won't need to setup the rest of the tools mentioned below except perhaps the Reference Manager mentioned in step~\ref{list:refmanager}.
   

   \begin{enumerate}
   \item RedHat: sudo yum -y install
     texlive-collection-fontsrecommended
     texlive-biblatex-{apa,apa-doc,ieee,ieee-doc}
     texlive-{xargs,lipsum,lastpage,luatex,pseudocode,url,examplep,listings,xspace,pgf,tikz,amsfonts,amsmath,amssymb,siunitx,svn-multi,subfig,fixme,textpos,biblatex,makeglos,nomencl,xwatermark,ltxkeys,framed,boondox,printlen}
     Getting biber installed on older RedHat systems is a bit tricky
     for unclear reasons.  The metapackage you need is at
     https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/cbm/Biber/ 
   \item Debian/Ubuntu:
     sudo apt-get -y install texlive-full pgf latex-xcolor
     If you don't want to install everything, this list of packages is known
     to work: sudo apt-get -y install texlive texlive-luatex texlive-latex-extra
     texlive-science texlive-generic-extra texlive-lang-european
     texlive-lang-german latex-xcolor texlive-pictures pgf
     texlive-bibtex-extra texlive-publishers chktex evince
     fonts-lmodern lmodern biber
   \end{enumerate}
 \item Get a LaTeX Integrated Development Environment (recommended, but not required)
   \url{http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/} or
   \url{http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/}
   Some editors may include LaTeX support.
   If you want to learn a very powerful (but old-fashioned) editor \url{http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/}
      Install the auctex package by: M-x list-packages, click on AUCTeX

    \item Get a references manager (recommended, but not required)\label{list:refmanager}
   \url{http://jabref.sourceforge.net/}  (You may have to install a Java JRE first.)
   The reference library is in \path{references.bib} by default.
   It is just a text file that can be edited, but be careful with the formatting.
   A common mistake is to forget ``,'' at the end of each piece of an entry/line.

   If you are going to make glossaries or acronym lists, you will need
   a perl interpreter.  Only windows usually needs this installed:
   \url{http://www.activestate.com/activeperl}

 \item Get supporting programs for some tools.
   For glossaries under windows, you will need to install Perl
   \url{http://strawberryperl.com/}
   (it is already installed on the other platforms.)
   
 \item Try building the \path{main.tex} file.  If you get errors, there
   is something wrong with your LaTeX installation.  Fix those first.

   
 \item Rename the \path{main.tex} file with your information (optional).
   DEGREE-NAME-YEAR is the recommended scheme 
   e.g. \path{msc-foley-2015.tex}.
   This is referred to as the "Main" file.
 \item Set your UI to use \path{lualatex} as the processor.
   If you are typing commands in manually, this is by typing in \path{lualatex main.tex}
   
 \item Open and read the options at the top of the previous file and set
   it up for your document.
   You will need to fill in the title and author at least.

 \item Start editing all of the \path{.tex} files with your content.

 \item Compile the document by running lualatex on the Main file, run the bibliography tool, then view the result.

 \item When you print, make sure that the scale is 100\%.
   If you allow it to resize when printing, the margins won't be right.
   If the  margins aren't right, then the RU logo will not look right on the
   cover.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Important Details}

\begin{itemize}
\item Make absolutely sure that your \path{references.bib} is in UTF-8.  If it is another format (CP1251,etc) you may get weird problems with any accented characters.
  {\em Students have run into encoding issues in the past and it has taken a surprisingly long time to debug.}

\item Make sure the rest of the files, particularly the \path{.tex} file are in UTF8 or are at least in the same encoding.
  If the files are in different encoding, you will discover errors with accented characters when you try to include them together.
  Watch out for line endings. Linux, Windows, and OSX all use different line endings in text files.

\item You may wish biber/biblatex instead of bibtex.
(The template may already do this.)
Otherwise Icelandic characters may not work properly in your \path{references.bib} file.
TexMaker and TeXStudio require a configuration change to do this.
%Refer to the ``...Projects'' guide above.

\item Be consistent about UPPER and lower case in naming files.
  Windows doesn't care (but some programs in Windows do).
  OSX sometimes cares.
  Linux always cares.
\item When using this template with SVN, you will want to tell it to ignore the extensions listed in Appendix~\ref{appendix:latex-gen}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limited Access}
In general, access to the MSc thesis shall be open.
If restricting access to a thesis is sought, e.g.\ for the purpose of protecting intellectual property or protecting commercial interests of an industrial partner participating in the MSc project, permission needs to be acquired, see {\em Reglur um skil á lokaritgerðum og lokaverkefnum við Háskólann í Reykjavík\/} (\url{http://www.ru.is/bokasafn/skemman}).
If restriction of access to a thesis is granted it should be clearly stated in the thesis right after the keywords following the abstract with specification of the date at which the restriction of access should be lifted.

% \subsection{Submission and Deadlines}
% The official completion of the MSc thesis is signified by the student submitting the final electronic (PDF) version of the thesis, signed by himself/herself, the supervisor(s) and the examiner to the SSE office and uploaded to Skemman, (see \url{https://www.skemman.is}).
% See also RU's rules for submission of theses and final projects ({\em Reglur um skil á lokaritgerðum og lokaverkefnum við Háskólann í Reykjavík\/}, \url{http://www.ru.is/bokasafn/skemman}).

% If a student plans to graduate in a particular graduation ceremony, the following deadlines must be respected.
% Should any of the deadlines below not be respected the student will have to wait for the following graduation ceremony before he/she can graduate.
% Students are responsible for adhering to these deadlines and are advised to deliver their work in good time.
% The deadline schedule for the purpose of graduation is as follows (where $t$ is the graduation date and the
% numbers refer to the number of days prior to graduation) as shown on Table~\ref{tab:deadlines}.
% \begin{table}

% \end{tablenotes}
% \caption{Schedule for thesis according to expected graduation date.}\label{tab:deadlines}
% \end{threeparttable}
% \end{table}

\subsection{Thesis Defense (Oral Examination Procedure)}
The examiner is selected by the Department Head in consultation with the supervisor(s).  
The choice of examiner needs to be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies.  
The examiner shall have the qualifications necessary to supervise the thesis, but must not have collaborated in the project on which the thesis is based and must fulfil the rules of Reykjavík University on impartiality of examiners.
The oral examination shall be open to the public and shall be announced through appropriate channels with at least 3 days notice.  
The examination should take the form of an approximately 30 minute presentation by the student, followed by questions from the examiner, School representative (most often the Department Head), supervisor(s) and the audience.  
The audience then leaves the room and the examiner(s), supervisor and School representative have the opportunity to put further questions to the candidate and, as appropriate, request modifications to the thesis.  
Subsequently, the candidate leaves the room and the examiner, School representative and supervisor(s) deliberate and decide upon the grade.  
Normally, the student will be informed of the grade the next day.  
If the thesis is subject to confidentiality, or for other valid reasons approved by the Director of Graduate Studies, the oral examination may be closed to the public.
\subsection{Grading}
The appointed examiner shall evaluate the thesis and the oral defense of the thesis, together with the
supervisor(s) and the department's representative.  
One grade shall be awarded for the thesis and defence.  
The minimum passing grade is 6.0, see Guidelines for grading MSc theses in the appendix.  
The following factors shall be taken into account:

\begin{itemize}
\item Significance and originality of work
\item Scientific and technological challenge and results
\item Methodological quality
\item Presentation
\end{itemize}

The number of ECTS credits awarded for the Master's project shall be taken into account.  
Thus, significantly more demands in terms of originality, quantity and scientific quality of the work should be placed on the student for a 60 ECTS thesis than a 30 ECTS thesis.
